Welcome to CSE 494! This course focuses on competitive programming and advanced algorithmic problem-solving techniques.

## Course Overview

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to competitive programming, covering fundamental algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving strategies commonly used in programming contests. Students will develop their algorithmic thinking skills through weekly practice problems and competitions.

## Topics Covered

The course covers a wide range of topics including:

- **Foundations**: Basic algorithms and data structures
- **Graph Algorithms**: Graph traversal, shortest paths, and network flows
- **Dynamic Programming**: Advanced DP techniques and optimization
- **Data Structures**: Trees, range queries, and segment trees
- **Advanced Topics**: String algorithms, number theory, combinatorics, computational geometry, and game theory

## Course Format

- **Weekly Competitions**: 2-hour in-person contests with problems worth points
- **Codeforces Participation**: Earn credit by solving problems in rated contests
- **Practice Problems**: In-class problems and course materials for skill development
