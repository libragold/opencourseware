# Open Courseware

A Docusaurus-based website for course documentation.

## Structure

- `docs/` - Course documentation (edit markdown files here)
- `src/` - Docusaurus source files (pages, CSS, etc.)
- `static/` - Static assets (images, etc.)

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

3. Build for production:
```bash
npm run build
```

## Editing Course Content

Edit markdown files directly in `docs/cse494s26/`. The development server will automatically reload with your changes.

## Course Structure

Markdown files should include frontmatter with at least a `title` field:

```markdown
---
title: "Foundations"
---

# Foundations
...
```
